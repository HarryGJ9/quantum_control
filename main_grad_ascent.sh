# This file exectutes gradient ascent on 5 different genetically optimised genomes and outputs the one with highest fidelity.

#!/bin/bash

# Enter initial genome

# Run (Carrie's) spinnet for a certain number of generations to output 5 genetically optimised genomes


# Setup loop which executes gradient ascent over each genome

# Output the 5 optimised genomes, pick the best one and plot
